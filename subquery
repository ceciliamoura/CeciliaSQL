This was a query to find the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers:

SELECT country.country,
	COUNT (customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY country.country,
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

Followed by a query to identify the top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries I identified in the previous step:

SELECT country.country,
	city.city,
	COUNT (customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
WHERE country.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')	
GROUP BY country.country,
	city.city
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC


Same query using subquery strategy:

SELECT country.country,
	city.city,
	COUNT (customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
WHERE country.country IN (
	SELECT country.country
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY country.country
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10)
GROUP BY country.country,
	city.city
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

Example of a query creating a CTE. I called it ‘customer_id per country’ and it contains the following columns: ‘country’ and ‘customer_id’

	-- CTE: customer_id per country
customers_id_country_cte (country, customer_id) AS
(SELECT country, customer_id 
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY country,
	customer_id
ORDER BY country)
